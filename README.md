# Blockchain-based-Land-Registry-System

Land Registration is a simple Dapp based on the Ethereum Blockchain. It
can be used as an alternative to the existing approach. Here the land owner
registers the land details along with the land value by providing necessary
proofs. Only a registrar or government authority who is registered as the
SuperAdmin and admin can do the registration process. Lands coming
under a particular area can register to the system only through the admin
assigned to that area. The smart contract has been written in such a way
that the owner has to transfer his full asset to the buyer and no partial
transaction of the asset is allowed. Even though the registration process
requires a government authority, the entire process is transparent and the
transaction happens between the two clients without any intermediaries.
